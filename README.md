# Customer_Churn_Prediction
I have selected two datasets that are both focused on predicting churn. However, one dataset has more categorical attributes while the other has more numerical attributes. This presents an interesting opportunity to compare and contrast how different machine learning models perform on each dataset. By doing this, we can gain insights into which types of models are better suited for handling different types of data, and how we can optimize our models to achieve the best possible results. Ultimately, our goal is to build accurate and effective models for predicting churn.
